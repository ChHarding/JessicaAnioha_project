The update for the Version 1 Python prototype of the Cognitive Wellness & Memory Aid App.
Core features implemented so far: elderly users can add, view, and mark tasks as Completed, Skipped, or 
Deferred, while caregivers can monitor all elderly usersâ€™ tasks through a dashboard. The app includes 
a simple text-based interface and time-based reminder checking. Additionally, basic data structures 
were created to store user information and tasks, ensuring the system can track multiple users and 
their task statuses. This version lays the foundation for future improvements such as audio/text notifications, 
a graphical user interface, persistent storage, and enhanced accessibility features. Screenshots and test runs have been conducted to verify core functionality and usability.
